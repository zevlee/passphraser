# Passphraser

Passphraser is a password generator that accepts any text file and treats each word as a possible input. So a text file like this...
```
alpha bravo
charlie delta echo
foxtrot
```
...will result in a generated password like this with the default settings.
```
Delta-Charlie-6-Bravo-Charlie-Alpha-Echo
```
